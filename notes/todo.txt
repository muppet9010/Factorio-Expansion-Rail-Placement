OUTCOME - need to do this as a rotatable entity just so that blueprints can be rotated. Don't need all the rotations in the entity, just the ones that BPs can be rotated through.

- Do as an arithmetic combinator as this supports 4 way graphics.
- Move all the details of a rail out of here to a generic list we then build from.
- In the control side when the user presses R we need to step through our entity types, then at the end of the list do a rotation on the start of the next loop.
- Expect 1 entity for each:
    - N, S, E, W
    - NNE, SSE, SSW, NNW
    - NE, SE, SW, SE
    - NEE, SEE, SWW, NEE
